## Rules

Carioca is a multiplayer game which consist of 7 rounds. The aim of each
round is to get rid of the 12 cards in your hand or end with the smallest
amount of points as possible. During the game you have to put together a 
combination of three-of-a-kind and/or straights. 

At the start of each round each player receives 12 random cards from a common
deck of 52 cards and one card is left in the discard. All the cards in the
discard are visible by the players. At the begining of the player turn, the top
card of the deck or the discard (if it has not lower its hand) can be drawn.
During the player turn, it can:
- lower its hand with the minimum cards required in the round, or
- drop cards on any of the lower hands if they match and the player has lower
  its hand, or
- do nothing.
At the end of the turn one card should be discarded. 

Three-of-a-kind requires 3 cards to lower the hand, these must have the same
value. Straights must have the same suit and be consecutive values. They need
4 cards to lower the hand. The order of the cards is cyclical, i.e.
combinations like QKA2 are allowed. The joker is a wildcard and can be used as
the players see fit, but keeping at least 4 card between joker cards.
